In this dazzling folder, there are three brilliant pearls hidden in the vast sea of knowledge - SkyQian's Three Thousand Books source is vast and boundless, Meow Young Master's books source is gentle and delicate, and the "Reading" APP source is filled with a gentle stream of wisdom. 

After careful screening and elimination, those elusive illusions and mysterious paths that rely on mysterious environments have been removed, leaving only the book source treasures that have been tested by time and personally tested and used. 

These collections of books are like twinkling stars, illuminating the path of knowledge. 

Each document contains infinite possibilities, waiting for us to appreciate them together and savor their charm.

  > Due to personal preference, although novels are not my daily favorite, I only keep a hand carved source as a souvenir.
  > Although this source has undergone initial inspection, it has not been thoroughly explored for a long time, and it may not be satisfactory, so it is not highly recommended.
  > If you love the world of novels, it is recommended to search for them yourself in order to find the source of your dreams and enjoy the journey of reading.

> **Note：**
> 
> In the depths of this mysterious folder lies a carefully selected source of Legado open source reading books, whose effectiveness is not certain, but it is a top priority for exploring reading journeys at present.
> The name Legado, like the dawn, leads us into the hall of knowledge, and this book source is the beacon that illuminates the path ahead.
